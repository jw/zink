	<p> 
		ElevenBits is a one-person company, started by Jan Willems in 
		2000, with a strong focus on Kaizen (改善, Japanese for "change 
		for the better"). This quality concept can loosely be translated 
		as "continuous improvement".
	</p>

	<p>
		ElevenBits strongly applies and recommends the agile process 
		management. ElevenBits uses a set of interrelated practices and 
		rules that optimize the development environment, reduce 
		organizational overhead, and closely synchronize market 
		requirements with iterative prototypes.
	</p>

	<p> 
		Using modern process control theory, ElevenBits tries to build 
		the best possible software given the available resources, 
		acceptable quality, and required release dates. Useful product 
		functionality is delivered every thirty days as requirements, 
		architecture, and design emerge, even when using unstable 
		technologies.
