I have noticed that terminals in Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa (XFCE4-panel 12.2, 64-bits,
kernel 4.15.0-43 generic) display asterisks when the user needs to type their root
password. I've tried this is UXTerm, Gnome-Terminal, Terminator and XFCE4 Terminal.
I believe this is universal. I've looked on the advanced tab on the documentation
page of the terminal and found no mention of that (at least explicitly). I've
searched on the terminal settings a way to disable this feature -- so far, nothing
related to it. I've also tried the visudo way of showing asterisks by adding the
pwfeedback line, but in my case, this line doesn't exist, so I can't delete it to
try a fix. It's become a standard feature.

I'd like to know how to disable this feature and maintain the plain invisible
 feature when typing password in terminals.

sudo mv /etc/sudoers.d/0pwfeedback /etc/sudoers.d/0pwfeedback.disabled

GEEKBENCH

Geekbench is a cross-platform processor benchmark, with a scoring system that
separates single-core and multi-core performance,[2][3] and workloads that simulate
real-world scenarios. The software benchmark is available for macOS, Windows, Linux,
Android and iOS. Geekbench has also measured GPU performance in areas such as image
processing and computer vision since Geekbench 4.

PYTHON LINE LENGTH

Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. Makes sense.
[...] For flowing long blocks of text (docstrings or comments),
limiting the length to 72 characters is recommended.
